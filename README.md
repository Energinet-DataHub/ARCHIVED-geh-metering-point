# MeteringPoints

## Intro

The metering point domain is in charge of maintaining grid areas and creating the different metering point types in their respective grid areas, as well as maintaining the metering point state.
Furthermore the domain supports metering point master data updates not related to an energy supplier or consumer updates.

These are the processes maintained by this domain.
