#Connection of metering point with status new

This process is used when the grid access provider wants to change the connection status for a metering point from new to connected.
In grid areas with default supply, a consumption metering point will be transferred to the default balance supplier following connection, unless a balance supplier has already been registered for the metering point.
Submission of metered data commences from the day the metering point is connected.
