# Update production obligation

The TSO can update whether or not a production metering point is subject to a production obligation.
This business process is used by the TSO to update master data information.
For metering points covered by a production obligation, energy suppliers cannot implement a change of energy supplier and only the energy supplier registered for the production obligation may implement move-ins.

An update to production obligation will mean that all future change of energy supplier and move processes for the metering point are cancelled or stopped.
The TSO can only update master data if the energy supplier responsible for the production obligation is registered as the energy supplier for the metering point.
